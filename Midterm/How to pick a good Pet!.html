        <p>After you get an idea of what breed of dog you may be looking for, learn everything you can about that type
            of dog. By purchasing a puppy from a responsible breeder, you’ll have to anticipate the temperament, size,
            and grooming needs. Although each dog is different, this information can be valuable in making the best
            determination if a breed is right for your lifestyle and needs.</p>
