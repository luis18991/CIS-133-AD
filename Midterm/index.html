<p><br>Here are just a few questions to ask yourself when determining which dog is the best fit for your lifestyle?</p></br> 
    
    <p>You should ask yourself if you should adopt or purchase a dog from a breeder. Find the right dog that suits your lifestyle and see if he is a good fit for your home.  Dogs are unique just like humans in that they have distinct characteristics depending on the breed of the dog.  Some sites on the internet even offer personality quizzes to see if your breed persona or lifestyle fits, youâ€™re your needs.</p></br>
